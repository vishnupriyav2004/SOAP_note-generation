    "###  About the dataset \n",
    "**ACI-Bench** (Automatic Clinical Inference Benchmark) is a research dataset designed for developing and evaluating AI systems that can convert real-world doctor–patient dialogues into structured clinical documentation.  \n",
    "It provides pairs of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Narrative Conversations:** Natural doctor–patient transcripts. These are unstructured, free-flowing dialogues where a doctor interviews a patient, asks clarifying questions, discusses medical history, symptoms, lab tests, and next steps.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Structured Clinical Notes:** Professionally authored SOAP notes that summarize the conversation in a standardized medical format. SOAP stands for:\n",
    "  - **S (Subjective):** The patient’s reported symptoms, history, complaints.\n",
    "  - **O (Objective):** Clinician’s observations, exam findings, vital signs, test results.\n",
    "  - **A (Assessment):** Diagnoses and clinical reasoning.\n",
    "  - **P (Plan):** Recommended treatments, further tests, follow-up instructions.\n",
    "  ### 📌 Key Details\n",
    "- **Source:** [ACI-Bench GitHub](https://github.com/wyim/aci-bench)\n",
    "- **Format:** CSV file with two main columns: `datasetname` `dialogue` (the conversation) and `note` (the reference SOAP note).\n",
    "- **Use Case:** Automatic clinical note generation, summarization, and faithful text generation for medical AI research.\n",

    "Mason Ward is a pleasant 80-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of kidney stones. The patient was referred from his primary care physician. The onset of his pain began 1 week ago when he was in his barn moving hay when he had a sudden onset of right back pain. The patient initially thought his pain was due to throwing hay; however, he broke out into a sweat and became nauseated. He was seen by his primary care physician, who ordered a CT scan and told him that he had a kidney stone. He denies having kidney stones before, but states that his father has a history of kidney stones in the past. He explains that when he had pain, which has now resolved, it would radiate almost to his groin. The patient describes the pain as intermittent after he found out it was a kidney stone. He explains that he has been straining his urine, but has not seen anything. He denies any hematuria.\n",

The pain started from the right side and moved over and he feels it on the left side of his back. This has been going on for the last 4 days. Initially, the pain was intermittent, but over the last 48 hours it has been constant. He has taken Tylenol, but it does not seem to help. He thinks he has hematuria, but it is hard to detect but it does look a little off color. He endorses nausea and vomiting if he exerts himself or climbs the stairs to his apartment or runs to catch the bus. He also endorses dizziness and lightheadedness with pain in his abdomen.\n",

    "Mason Ward is a pleasant 80-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of kidney stones. The patient was referred from his primary care physician. The onset of his pain began 1 week ago when he was in his barn moving hay when he had a sudden onset of right back pain. The patient initially thought his pain was due to throwing hay; however, he broke out into a sweat and became nauseated. He was seen by his primary care physician, who ordered a CT scan and told him that he had a kidney stone. He denies having kidney stones before, but states that his father has a history of kidney stones in the past. He explains that when he had pain, which has now resolved, it would radiate almost to his groin. The patient describes the pain as intermittent after he found out it was a kidney stone. He explains that he has been straining his urine, but has not seen anything. He denies any hematuria.\n",
